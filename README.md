In my Digital Music Analysis SQL project, I tackled three sets of questions with varying complexity: Simple Queries, Moderate Queries, and Advanced Queries. Employing a broad array of SQL functions, I extracted insights from a music database, involving songs, albums, artists, and user interactions.

Simple Queries:
These basic queries focused on essential tasks like data retrieval, filtering, sorting, and basic aggregation to provide an overview of the music database.

Moderate Queries:
I then delved deeper, performing tasks such as joining tables, subqueries, and data transformation, enriching the analysis.

Advanced Queries:
In the final stage, I employed window functions, pivoting, and statistical analysis to reveal more intricate insights.

This project showcased the value of SQL in uncovering meaningful patterns and trends within digital music data, benefiting music enthusiasts and industry professionals.
